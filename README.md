# WanderLust
A full-stack web development project with the features of Authentication and Authorization implemented using passport package. Used Cloudinary to store data on cloud using Mongodb as database. I used Bootstrap as framework for CSS. CRUD operations were used in backend. Implemented MVC model to organize the code. I also used cookies to store the user's data for better experience.
